# Brainflix API

This was the first project writing back-end server-side code using the following:

* `Node.js`
* `Express.js`

The goal was to replace the heroku api provided by BrainStation in the first two sprints.

Requirements were to handle **GET**, **POST**, **PUT** & **DELETE** requests from our React front-end.

As an extra, I tried to incorporate GitFlow best practice by using a develop and feature branches.
